# Predicting Over/Under for the Home Team

This is my capstone project for the University of California Santa Cruz Course on Bayesian Statistics: Techniques and Models. Utilizing MCMC simulation in conjunction with self-collected data concerning English Premier League scores, the primary objective of this project is to construct a model that predicts the Over and Under outcomes at Home Football Venues using a Hierarchical Poisson Model. Furthermore, the project endeavors to forecast the goals scored by the home team by employing a Hierarchical Poisson Regressor.
